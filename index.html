<h2> and now it's time TO GET EMOTIONALLLLLL </h2>

<h3> Dear Parthinimus Rex, </h3>
<h4> Let's start at the beginning. The big bang. Right after that ish exploded there were a shitton of neutrons and protons and electrons </h4>
<h4> in this website, electrons have positive charge btw. </h4>
<h4> then u were born </h4>
<h4> We are now skipping to 2017, because your life was insignificant until you met us. </h4>
  <h4> Please see Sarah's birthday letter for 8/23/17 - 10/26/17. </h4>
  <h4> Please see Swetha's birthday tome for 10/26/17 - 11/15/17. </h4>
  <h4> we could recount all of that here, but you'd propbab;asodifj get mad at us for plagiarism </h4>
  <p> We could try to recall and write about all the random, weird, funny, emotionally deep, emotionally scarring, and comestible1  moments, but truthfully there have been
      far too many moments of significant to write about in a single website2. Where would we even start? Do we start at the Facebook Puzzle Hunt? (I know this was technically covered in Sarah's letter, but it 's
  still technically the start of the trio so it's significant enough to get a mention here) Or at any of the countless work sessions (aka laugh/cry sessions with only nominal amounts of productivity most days)? Or do we start all the way at Dead Week, when we stayed up until 6am vomiting feelings and talking about all of the deeper ~layers~ we all have?
  </p>
  <p>The truth is, there is no way to rank or even begin to enumerate all of the different memories we both have of these past six months because to us, each and every one of them is priceless and irreplaceable - just like you. (I gagged a little writing that, but screw it, it's your birthday) </p>
  <p> We couldn't imagine college without you (and tbh we probably both would not still be alive without your constant judgement and annoyingly sensible advice that we have a tendency to ignore), and we can't even begin to imagine what adventures the future has in store for us - but the only thing we know for sure is that it all started at the big bang. Right after that ish exploded...
  <h3> Love, </h3>
<h3> Sarahdactyl, and Swethasaurus </h3>
  <h6> 1. (that was Sarah's suggestion, if you couldn't already tell by the utter lack of sense it makes to include it in this context) </h6>
  <h6> 2. Also, it is 4am and we're tired and are too lazy. But we still like you (kinda) </h6>
  <p>Dear Father,
   I am so glad my letter has reached you from the war. I remember when we first met. We were at a quizbowl event. You managed to press the buzzer *just* slightly before I did for all the questions.
  <br> You know that they say: If someone knows the same trivia facts that you do, but they are slightly faster than you at hitting the buzzer, you're bound to be lifelong friends.
  <br>The fact that they say that is one trivia fact that I learned by meeting you, but so far, they couldn't have been more right. You inspire me every day with your passion for both the large and small. You don't let the minor setbacks hold you back, and you fight to push past the large ones. Truly an insparation for us all. Just don't forget that just as you (hopefully) care about all of us, we also care about you, and more than fame, success, and the glamourous life you're destined to have, we want you to be happy. We like you just the way you are, it's why we keep you around. Never change from your spunky self.
  <br>In conclusion: You're great. You deserve to be happy. Be yourself! And, above all: 
 <br>Happy 19th birthday man. Hope it's an excellent one.
 <br>Your friend,

  <br>Charizard</p>
