<h2> and now it's time TO GET EMOTIONALLLLLL </h2>

<h3> Dear Parthinimus Rex, </h3>
<h4> Let's start at the beginning. The big bang. Right after that ish exploded there were a shitton of neutrons and protons and electrons </h4>
<h4> in this website, electrons have positive charge btw. </h4>
<h4> then u were born </h4>
<h4> We are now skipping to 2017, because your life was insignificant until you met us. </h4>
  <h4> Please see Sarah's birthday letter for 8/23/17 - 10/26/17. </h4>
  <h4> Please see Swetha's birthday tome for 10/26/17 - 11/15/17. </h4>
  <h4> we could recount all of that here, but you'd propbab;asodifj get mad at us for plagiarism </h4>
  <p> We could try to recall and write about all the random, weird, funny, emotionally deep, emotionally scarring, and comestible1  moments, but truthfully there have been
      far too many moments of significant to write about in a single website2. Where would we even start? Do we start at the Facebook Puzzle Hunt? (I know this was technically covered in Sarah's letter, but it 's
  still technically the start of the trio so it's significant enough to get a mention here) Or at any of the countless work sessions (aka laugh/cry sessions with only nominal amounts of productivity most days)? Or do we start all the way at Dead Week, when we stayed up until 6am vomiting feelings and talking about all of the deeper ~layers~ we all have?
  </p>
  <p>The truth is, there is no way to rank or even begin to enumerate all of the different memories we both have of these past six months because to us, each and every one of them is priceless and irreplaceable - just like you. (I gagged a little writing that, but screw it, it's your birthday) </p>
  <p> We couldn't imagine college without you (and tbh we probably both would not still be alive without your constant judgement and annoyingly sensible advice that we have a tendency to ignore), and we can't even begin to imagine what adventures the future has in store for us - but the only thing we know for sure is that it all started at the big bang. Right after that ish exploded...
  <h3> Love, </h3>
<h3> Sarahdactyl, and Swethasaurus </h3>
  <h6> 1. (that was Sarah's suggestion, if you couldn't already tell by the utter lack of sense it makes to include it in this context) </h6>
  <h6> 2. Also, it is 4am and we're tired and are too lazy. But we still like you (kinda) </h6>
  <p>Dear Father,</p>
  
  <p>I am so glad my letter has reached you from the war. I remember when we first met. We were at a quizbowl event. You managed to press the buzzer *just* slightly before I did for all the questions.</p>
 
  <p> You know that they say: If someone knows the same trivia facts that you do, but they are slightly faster than you at hitting the buzzer, you're bound to be lifelong friends.</p>
 
  <p>The fact that they say that is one trivia fact that I learned by meeting you, but so far, they couldn't have been more right. You inspire me every day with your passion for both the large and small. You don't let the minor setbacks hold you back, and you fight to push past the large ones. Truly an insparation for us all. Just don't forget that just as you (hopefully) care about all of us, we also care about you, and more than fame, success, and the glamourous life you're destined to have, we want you to be happy. We like you just the way you are, it's why we keep you around. Never change from your spunky self.</p>
  
  <p>In conclusion: You're great. You deserve to be happy. Be yourself! And, above all: </p>
  
  <p>Happy 19th birthday man. Hope it's an excellent one.</p>
 
  <p>Your friend,</p>
 
  <p>Charizard</p>
  <h4> Oh wait this is where I'm supposed to write my part??? Are you sure??? This feels disorganized but it's fine it's fine </h4>
<h4> So Parth.... have you done the EE homework yet? </h4>
<h4> I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I just figured this wouldn't be complete without a mention to the cause of 80% of the 3Am breakdowns that you end up witnessing and then counseling me and Sarah through </h4>
<p> In all seriousness, though, I don't know what I would do without you. Thank you for being my Zellerbach buddy (and for finally seeing a dance show with me), my rock through every success and failure, my sounding board for all of my questionable ideas (I will probably continue to refuse to admit that you are right until I'm in too deep, at which point you will also have to see a horrific dumpster fire of a stress breakdown for the 145th time, so sorry about that), my accomplice for hiding surprise birthday parties from people under the pretense of a Regents event (we gotta work on those lying skills tho), my supposed significant other according to 70% of the people in my life and the 50% in yours who don’t know Sarah, my confidant for all the random drama in my life, and my general partner-in-crime for life. </p>

<p>  (and for saving my butt in every EE lab.) </p>

<p> Thank you for reminding of the things that actually matter whenever I work myself into a frenzy, and for also not letting my head get too big with your constant mentions of all the CS assignments you finished six months in advance.

While I find it incredibly annoying that you see right through all my crap and call me out on it every time, and I still weirdly get surprised every time you mention something you could have only learned from looking at my calendar *side eye intensifies*, I don’t think I would be the person I am today if I hadn’t met you that fateful day in August. I’m thankful every single day that we met and have stayed friends because truthfully, I don’t know what I would do without you. Your kindness, work ethic, (relative) humbleness, and uncanny ability to be exactly the person someone needs at every single moment without them ever having to say a word inspires me to be a better person every day. I don’t think I will ever be half the person that you are, but I’ll spend the rest of my life trying to work up the high standard that you set.

I hope that every day of your life brings you the same joy that you bring to me and so many others, and I look forward to many more years of friendship and birthday celebrations complete with awkward birthday notes and janky websites. Happy Birthday you nerd.</p>

  <h4>With love,</h4>
  <h4> Swetha </h4>


  <h3> okay this is Sarah now </h3>
  <p> this is super organized amirite. umm anyway i just want to thank you for being my friend and putting up with my shit (you are probably one of the best parts of college). there is no one i would rather stay up late with even if you do sometimes try to EMBARASS ME IN PUBLIC ON PURPOSE and not show me letters and mess up my hair but i just want u to know that even when i say i hate u i think it is impossible to hate u. im really glad that we can listen to really good music together and gossip and be truly terrible people but in the end it's fine bc we r the best ppl!!! and u can subtweet me about this letter when i roast ur sentence structure in the future i guess.... also thank you for helping me with all of the things and being super nice when im hella annoying and i really appreciate your reminders!!! bc i have a total lack of independence and m clingy af but i think its ok so anyway u better still talk to me next year and stay up late with me bc otherwise there will be consequences. </p>
    <h3> Love, </h3>
<h3> Sarah</h3>
